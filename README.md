# Employee-transaction


Develop a REST Api for multiple purposes. Create two collections in MongoDB one for employee records and another for storing transaction (like Add, Edit and Delete) details of the first collections.


# Specifications:

* Use a single URL for Get, Add, Update and Delete API for employee records.

* Employeeâ€™s first name and last name should be saved in lowercase in DB but when getting data from DB, the first    letter should be capitalized.

* On each transaction save the transaction details in the 2nd collection.

*Create a simple panel to perform Get, Add, Update and Delete actions using AJAX and create APIs.
